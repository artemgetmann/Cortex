# Skill: Create a 4-on-the-Floor Kick Pattern

Use this procedure to program a basic house/techno kick pattern in FL Studio's Channel Rack.

## Prerequisites

- FL Studio is open and focused.
- At least one drum channel exists, including `Kick`.

## Steps

1. Press `F6` to open or focus the Channel Rack.
2. Find the `Kick` channel row.
3. Verify you are on the correct row with Hint Bar confirmation:
   - Move the mouse over channel names in the rack.
   - Read the Hint Bar at the bottom of the FL Studio window.
   - Only proceed when the hint confirms the `Kick` target.
4. In the `Kick` row, click step buttons `1`, `5`, `9`, and `13`.
   - These are quarter notes (four-on-the-floor) in a 16-step bar.
   - Step buttons are the 16 small rectangular cells to the right of the channel name.
   - Lit = active. Dark = inactive.
5. Press `Space` to play.
6. Verify the pattern is playing correctly.
7. If you click the wrong step or row, press `Ctrl+Z` to undo, then re-apply the correct clicks.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `F6`: Open/focus Channel Rack
- `Space`: Play/Stop
- `Ctrl+Z`: Undo

## Common Mistakes

- Wrong row clicked: channel rows are close together (about 20 px apart).
- Channel muted: the channel's green LED is off, so no sound plays.
- Wrong transport mode: `PAT` should be lit, not `SONG` (top-left transport area).
- Wrong pattern selected: edits were made to a different pattern slot.

## Verification Checklist

- Wave Candy shows activity during playback.
- Transport timer advances while playing.
- Step buttons `1`, `5`, `9`, and `13` are lit in the `Kick` row.
