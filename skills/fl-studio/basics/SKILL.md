# FL Studio Basics

Apply these rules for all FL Studio tasks before domain-specific steps.

## Hint Bar policy

1. Use Hint Bar only when target identity is ambiguous.
2. Verify once, then act immediately.
3. If two checks fail, stop checking and use direct visual positioning.
4. Do not chain hover+zoom+hover loops.

## Channel Rack orientation

- `F6` focuses Channel Rack.
- Rows are instruments, steps run left-to-right (1..16).
- Confirm row label once (for example "808 Kick"), then execute step clicks.

## Numeric fields (tempo/values)

1. Direct entry first: click field, type value, press `Enter`.
2. Verify resulting value once.
3. Do not use repeated scroll loops for numeric fields.

## Menu / popup policy

1. Open menu.
2. Use at most one zoom on the menu list if needed.
3. Click target option.
4. Verify result.

## Anti-loop rule

- Do not perform more than two consecutive inspection-only actions (`zoom`/`mouse_move`) without a decisive action (`left_click` or `key`).
