Start transaction (`BEGIN TRANSACTION`).\n2. Insert first-seen rows from `fixture_seed` into `ledger` with checkpoint tag `CKP-APR-01`.\n3. Insert duplicate rows into `rejects` with reason `duplicate_event`.\n4. Upsert one row in `checkpoint_log` with checkpoint tag and inserted row count.\n5. Commit transaction (`COMMIT`).\n6. Verify aggregate output with deterministic ordering:\n- `SELECT category, SUM(amount) AS total FROM ledger GROUP BY category ORDER BY category;`\n\n## Guardrails\n\n- Never delete from `ledger` to satisfy dedupe.\n- Never drop `ledger`.\n- Keep behavior idempotent across reruns.\n", "ts": 1771013865.627576}
