# Docs Index

This folder is split into active Memory V2 docs and archived historical tracks.

## Active Source Of Truth
- `docs/MEMORY-V2-AGNOSTIC-PLAN.md` - architecture requirements and implementation status.
- `docs/MEMORY-V2-BENCHMARKS.md` - benchmark protocol, commands, and interpretation.
- `docs/MEMORY-V2-CURRENT-FLOW.html` - current CLI Memory V2 runtime flow diagram.
- `docs/MEMORY-V2-ARCHITECTURE-COMPARE.md` - legacy vs current architecture comparison.
- `docs/VM-RUNNER.md` - isolated VM runner setup and control scripts.

## Archived (Historical, Not Active)
- `docs/archive/memory-v2-history/` - older transfer plans, A/B findings, baseline snapshots, pilot handoffs.
- `docs/archive/fl-studio-legacy/` - original FL Studio track docs and legacy architecture diagram.

## Usage Rules
- When updating behavior or implementation decisions, update active docs first.
- Do not treat files in `docs/archive/` as current requirements.
- If you revive an archived idea, copy it into an active doc with explicit rationale.
